# Summary of Documentation Files
## Main Datasets
[Documentation for transmitted Basic Safety Message (BSM)](BSMdocumentation.md)  
[Documentation for received (Rx) Basic Safety Message (BSM)](BSMRxdocumentation.md)  
[Documentation for Roadside Equipment (RSE)](RSEdocumentation.md)

A high-level look of the variables in these dataset is available [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~scunchen/Mcity/tree/).

## Data Nuggets
[Documentation for Plymouth Intersection](PlymouthIntersection.md)  
[Documentation for Stop Sign Intersection](StopSignIntersection.md)  
The remaining data nuggets should have documentation within the folder itself
